# Chess Titans RTX
This is an RTX Remix mod for the Chess Titans

Constant frametime and fov patches by [Adam](https://github.com/adamplayer)

## Chess Titans RTX Launcher:
The launcher ensures that graphics level is set to 3, and disables the maximized property in case it was enabled in previous session.

Without the launcher, borderless window won't align properly.

*Don't mind the `.bat` extension, this is a Powershell script. This script makes use of [PS-BAT](https://github.com/Kamilkampfwagen-II/PS-BAT), which is makes it more convenient than using terminal or a separate batch file to run the script.*
